It's again the same, I caught the feeling at the worst time possible, now again all the same just left alone to cry alone
Why I am aren't able to handle such a thing, I did it before... it the same I wanna talk to you about everything, but how? I just don't know what to do... Why I even like you... And in past when I did, I messed up everything and now again....and what I am left with us tears, tears, tears and with a person who won't be able to handle itself for months

 
</p>
<p class="blog-text">There is my paper, just 1 month left, and now I am at the bed, Unable to think anything... know this will happen, and I won't be able to think clearly, will feel lonely, will going to have tears and everything and I still just want talk to you, hoping won't and also incase I just for it wrote a lot of how to handle this... But nothing seems to be working... Why???
I could have wrote you, but you didn't seem interested, felt like you didn't wanna talk or I was just forcing you to, and at same I was unable,  take it, anymore. And again what would I say? 

</p>
        <p class="blog-text"> Again, it's my fault that I shouldn't have expected anything, and maybe I deserve this, whatever the case, I can't, I can't take it anymore, don't even know whom to say or express myself... Only person whom I trust... 
 </p>
<p class="blog-text">Maybe I will, but right now I just messed up everything including me. And I can't stop thinking about it... 
 
</p>
        <p class="blog-text">
            Whatever,  hope you doing well and having fun at Delhi üå±<br>
