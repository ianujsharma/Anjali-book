It's again the same, I caught the feeling at the worst time possible, now again all the same just left alone to cry alone
Why I am aren't able to handle such a thing, I did it before... it the same I wanna talk to you about everything, but how? I just don't know what to do... Why I even like you... And in past when I did, I messed up everything and now again....and what I am left with us tears, tears, tears and with a person who won't be able to handle itself for months

 
</p>
<p class="blog-text">There is my paper, just 1 month left, and now I am at the bed, Unable to think anything... know this will happen, and I won't be able to think clearly, will feel lonely, will going to have tears and everything and I still just want talk to you, hoping won't and also incase I just for it wrote a lot of how to handle this... But nothing seems to be working... Why???
I could have wrote you, but you didn't seem interested, felt like you didn't wanna talk or I was just forcing you to, and at same I was unable,  take it, anymore. And again what would I say? 

</p>
        <p class="blog-text"> Again, it's my fault that I shouldn't have expected anything, and maybe I deserve this, whatever the case, I can't, I can't take it anymore, don't even know whom to say or express myself... Only person whom I trust... 
 </p>
<p class="blog-text">Maybe I will, but right now I just messed up everything including me. And I can't stop thinking about it... 
 
</p>
        <p class="blog-text">
            Whatever,  hope you doing well and having fun at Delhi üå±<br>

I still remember during my foundation exam, I used to go at the top and sat there and after revising, looking in to emptiness, just admire what was, and that simple routine, even how hectic was the day, makes me feel relaxed. And I was lacking that feeling since then, till I text her that night, in very long time I expressed myself or shared something to someone and everything felt perfect.üéê
I just admire, how I pursued or transitioned or everything I build for her, accepting she will never able to find out or see any of these, but still those thoughts always made me smile, from inspiration (wow!) to friend to a person whom I will never forget, weaving all those stories, of what I felt.‚ù§Ô∏è<br>
May be that's why I still feel the same way for her. ü™∂<br><br>

There are lot going on my head, like I want to talk but if I do, it could ruin your dreams and your future ; or should I think in long term Instead of generalising things in short term.  (and lot like are you okay?, why I did this? Kya hua hoga? And I can't... Keeping aside. ) <br>
Your parent want to you built your career, and you to be a successful person, and it just hit me, cause I also want the same, I want to see you grow, fulfill your dreams, have a life and have what you want, and I can't have me distracting or ruining,  you. (and your potential)<br>
So I came to an conclusion, I will stick to that 5 year goals, we agreed upon! (though I want to talk and know what you desires?, but I can't üò≠).
As you mean a lot to me(you don't know how much), and for few days, I will not going to cost', whole life. <br><br>Also,  there is nothing wrong or wiered with you so, please stop thinking about what was, there is lot, ahead, I promise there will! üíê
